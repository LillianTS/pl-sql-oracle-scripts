# Oracle - PL/SQL Scripts

This repository showcases my hands-on experience with **Oracle PL/SQL**, using the built-in **HR schema** to simulate real-world business scenarios and reinforce advanced database programming skills.

## üß† What‚Äôs Inside

- ‚úÖ Use of **explicit and implicit cursors** to loop through and manipulate HR data  
- ‚úÖ Application of **%ROWTYPE** and **RECORD** types to handle complex row structures  
- ‚úÖ Creation of **nested tables** and **VARRAY collections** for data aggregation and advanced manipulation  
- ‚úÖ Design of reusable **stored procedures** and **functions** to perform tasks like bonus calculations, employee promotions, and department analytics  
- ‚úÖ Implementation of **BEFORE and AFTER triggers** to audit sensitive operations such as salary updates or new hires  
- ‚úÖ Development of **views** and **multi-table joins** to generate HR reports and insights  

## üìÅ Structure

- `sql/`: SQL queries and analytical joins using HR tables  
- `plsql/`: PL/SQL components, including:
  - `procedure_*.sql`: Stored procedures  
  - `function_*.sql`: User-defined functions  
  - `trigger_*.sql`: Triggers for auditing or enforcing business rules  
  - `cursor_*.sql`: Cursor usage examples  
  - `collection_*.sql`: Scripts using collections like nested tables or varrays  

## üíº Why It Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Build modular and maintainable PL/SQL code  
- Translate business rules into logic-driven procedures and triggers  
- Work with Oracle‚Äôs procedural language extensions to SQL  
- Analyze and transform relational data in meaningful ways
