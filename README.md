Oracle - PL/SQL Scripts
This repository showcases my hands-on experience with Oracle PL/SQL, using the built-in HR schema to simulate real-world business scenarios and reinforce advanced database programming skills.

🧠 What’s Inside
✅ Use of explicit and implicit cursors to loop through and manipulate HR data

✅ Application of %ROWTYPE and RECORD types to handle complex row structures

✅ Creation of nested tables and VARRAY collections for data aggregation and advanced manipulation

✅ Design of reusable stored procedures and functions to perform tasks like bonus calculations, employee promotions, and department analytics

✅ Implementation of BEFORE and AFTER triggers to audit sensitive operations such as salary updates or new hires

✅ Development of views and multi-table joins to generate HR reports and insights

📁 Structure
sql/: SQL queries and analytical joins using HR tables

plsql/: PL/SQL components, including:

Procedures (procedure_*.sql)

Functions (function_*.sql)

Triggers (trigger_*.sql)

Cursor and record examples (cursor_*.sql)

Collection operations (collection_*.sql)

💼 Why It Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:

Build modular and maintainable PL/SQL code

Translate business rules into logic-driven procedures and triggers

Work with Oracle’s procedural extensions to SQL

Analyze and transform relational data in meaningful ways

📍 This repository reflects a strong foundation in PL/SQL, which I aim to further apply in roles such as Database Developer, Data Analyst, or PL/SQL Intern.
